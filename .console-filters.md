# Console Error Filters

## Unavoidable Browser Errors

Some errors appear in the browser console that cannot be suppressed via JavaScript because they occur at the browser's network layer. These are harmless and do not affect functionality.

### Blob URL Source Map Errors

**Errors:**
```
Not allowed to load local resource: blob://nullhttp//localhost:5173/index.worker.bundle.min.worker.js.map
Not allowed to request resource
Cannot load blob://nullhttp//localhost:5173/index.worker.bundle.min.worker.js.map due to access control checks.
```

**Cause:** The `cornerstone-wado-image-loader` library uses web workers for DICOM decoding. The worker bundle includes source map references, but the URLs are malformed (`blob://nullhttp//` instead of `blob:http://`). This is a bug in the bundled worker file from the library.

**Impact:** None. These are just debug source map loading errors. The workers function correctly.

**Solution:** Filter them in your browser's DevTools console:

### Safari
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Click the filter icon (funnel)
3. In the filter text box, add: `-blob:// -"Not allowed to load"`
4. Errors matching these patterns will be hidden

### Chrome/Edge
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Click the filter icon (funnel)
3. Click "Default levels" dropdown → "Hide network"
4. Or add custom filter: `-blob:// -"Not allowed"`

### Firefox
1. Open DevTools Console
2. In the filter box at top, enter: `-blob:// -"Not allowed"`

These filters will hide the errors while still showing legitimate issues.

## Production Build

In production builds (not using Vite dev server), these errors typically don't appear because:
- Workers may be inlined or bundled differently
- Source maps are often disabled in production
- The Tauri desktop app uses different worker loading mechanisms

## Alternative: Disable Web Workers

If these errors are too distracting during development, you can disable web workers entirely:

In `src/lib/cornerstone/initCornerstone.ts`, change line 86:
```typescript
useWebWorkers: false, // Disable workers to avoid console errors (slower performance)
```

**Trade-off:** DICOM decoding will be slower since it runs on the main thread instead of worker threads.
